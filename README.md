## Flappy Bird Neural Network

Hey! This is a simple solver for the Flappy Bird game. I used it a teaching example in my Introduction to Deep Learning classes.

Here I used a Genetic Algorithm to train a simple, one-layered Neural Netwrk based in [this article](https://www.askforgametask.com/tutorial/machine-learning-algorithm-flappy-bird/)

### Install Requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### How to run
